# Operator Console

Inspired by Bloomberg Terminal, NASA Mission Control, and industrial SCADA systems, **Operator Console** is a dark-mode aesthetic designed around information density as a first principle.

Standard dark interfaces signal "comfortable night mode." Operator Console signals "this machine is live."

## Color System

| Role | Color | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Base | \`#0d1117\` (charcoal) | All background panes |
| Body text | \`#e6edf3\` (off-white) | Primary data labels |
| Active / Live | \`#f59e0b\` (amber) | Running jobs, live feeds, cursor |
| Success | \`#4ade80\` (phosphor green) | Completed, healthy, OK |
| Alert | \`#f87171\` (rose) | Errors, warnings, degraded |
| Muted | \`#8b949e\` | Secondary labels, annotations |
| Borders | \`#30363d\` | Pane dividers, separators |

The palette is deliberately narrow. Introducing a new color means introducing a new status category — never a decoration.

## Typography

Everything runs through a single typeface stack:

\`\`\`css
font-family: "JetBrains Mono", "Courier New", monospace;
\`\`\`

- **Pane labels**: 10px, \`font-bold uppercase tracking-widest text-amber-400\`
- **Data rows**: 12px, \`tabular-nums leading-5\`
- **Values**: 14–16px \`font-bold\` for primary metrics, 12px for context

## Layout Architecture

A console viewport is divided into **named panes** using 1px borders. Each pane has a header label and a content area.

\`\`\`
┌─ STATUS ─────────────────┬─ FEED ──────────────────┐
│ BUILD    ● PASSING       │ 14:32:01 deploy started  │
│ COVERAGE ● 94%           │ 14:32:08 tests passed    │
│ UPTIME   ● 99.97%        │ 14:32:11 container live  │
├─ METRICS ────────────────┴─────────────────────────┤
│ p50: 42ms  p95: 118ms  p99: 340ms  errors: 0.02%   │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

This structure communicates context immediately — unlike dashboards where the user must hunt for meaning.

## What Makes It Work

**Density is respect.** Expert users operating at high speed don't need breathing room — they need signal. Every row in an Operator Console interface earns its place by showing irreplaceable information.

**Restraint in color = trust in color.** When amber only ever means "live/active," the user trusts it instantly without reading. This is the same principle as traffic lights.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Decorative amber**: Using the accent color on hover states or borders drains its semantic power
2. **Mixed type stacks**: Introducing a proportional font for "headings" breaks the terminal grammar
3. **Rounded corners**: Operator Console requires \`rounded-none\` throughout — radius signals approachability, not precision
4. **Empty panes**: If a pane has no live data, it should show a "—" or "NO DATA", not whitespace
